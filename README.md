I like coding stuff that output approximately correct answers. 

I'm currently working on [Project X](https://github.com/NicoGrassetto/project-x) a platform where you can use generative models such as stable diffusion to create art and put it on the ethereum blockchain in a few clicks and for free! (work in progress ðŸ”¨)

I study data science and artificial intelligence at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence).
