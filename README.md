I write and make videos about machine learning, health and life.

I'm currently working on [Nutrify](https://github.com/mrdbourke/nutrify) an app where you can take a photo of food and learn about it.

I study data science and artificial intelligence at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence).
